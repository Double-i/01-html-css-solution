# HTML & CSS

The idea of this lab is to practice with HTML and CSS by implementing a responsive web page based on a provided mockup.


## Objectives

Complete the HTML and CSS files to make it look as the provided mockups: [Mockup desktop](mockup-desktop.png), [Mockup Mobile](mockup-mobile.png)

![Mockup desktop](mockup-desktop.png)


## Rules

- No CSS Framework is allowed for this first exercice. We think it's the best way to learn CSS.
- Follow all the rules mentioned in the [style guide](style-guide.png) (Colors, Typography, dimensions, spacing and responsive breakpoints).
- For any informations/rules that is not specified in the style guide, you can decide what is the appropriate value.


## Submission and Corrections

- Please validate your HTML with https://validator.w3.org/ and your CSS with https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ before submitting your answer.
- To check wether your work is satisfying, your project will be automatically deployed by Github Classroom and will check the results in Chrome (v85 or greater).


## Local development setup

Although you can directly open the [index.html](public/index.html) file with your browser and start coding, we advise you to use a development server such as [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server), which is a little development server written in Node.js with live reload capability.

Install globally with npm:
```sh
npm install -g live-server
```

Start the server by running the following command from your project directory:
```sh
live-server ./public
```

Once started, the server will serve the files in the `public` directory and automatically reload the browser when you make changes to any file.
