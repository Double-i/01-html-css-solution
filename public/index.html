          <p>
            Asteroids is a space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade game
            designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh and released in
            November 1979 by Atari, Inc.[2] The player controls a single
            spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by
            flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the
            asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit
            by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number
            of asteroids increases.

            Asteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age of
            arcade games; the game sold over 70,000 arcade cabinets and proved
            both popular with players and influential with developers. In the
            1980s it was ported to Atari's home systems, and the Atari VCS
            version sold over three million copies.[3] The game was widely
            imitated, and it directly influenced Defender,[4] Gravitar, and many
            other video games.
          </p>
          <p>
            Asteroids was conceived during a meeting between Logg and Rains, who
            decided to use hardware developed by Howard Delman previously used
            for Lunar Lander. Asteroids was based on an unfinished game titled
            Cosmos; its physics model, control scheme, and gameplay elements
            were derived from Spacewar!, Computer Space, and Space Invaders and
            refined through trial and error. The game is rendered on a vector
            display in a two-dimensional view that wraps around both screen
            axes.
