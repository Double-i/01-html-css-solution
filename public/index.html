        Description Asteroids is a space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade
        game designed by Lyle Rains, Ed Logg, and Dominic Walsh and released in
        November 1979 by Atari, Inc.[2] The player controls a single spaceship
        in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers.
        The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and
        saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers'
        counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids
        increases. Asteroids was one of the first major hits of the golden age
        of arcade games; the game sold over 70,000 arcade cabinets and proved
        both popular with players and influential with developers. In the 1980s
        it was ported to Atari's home systems, and the Atari VCS version sold
        over three million copies.[3] The game was widely imitated, and it
        directly influenced Defender,[4] Gravitar, and many other video games.
        Asteroids was conceived during a meeting between Logg and Rains, who
        decided to use hardware developed by Howard Delman previously used for
        Lunar Lander. Asteroids was based on an unfinished game titled Cosmos;
        its physics model, control scheme, and gameplay elements were derived
        from Spacewar!, Computer Space, and Space Invaders and refined through
        trial and error. The game is rendered on a vector display in a
        two-dimensional view that wraps around both screen axes. Read more
